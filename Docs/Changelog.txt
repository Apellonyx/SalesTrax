v0.1.3 2023-04-26
	- General description: Bugfixes. Unsaved changes popup. Validation Control functionality.
	- Detailed description:
		- Added a Windows standard "Save Changes?" dialog when attempting to quit the program with unsaved changes.
		- Added basic validation control through the creation of a "Validation Control" window.
			- This allows users to define custom validation strings for "Employee", "Location", and "Department" fields,
				such that records with fields that don't match the validation strings will become invalid. This is meant
				to act as a basic whitelist/blacklist filter.
		- Changed the appearance of popup windows to be more consistent with Windows standard toplevels.
		- Fixed three outstanding bugs related to sorting and filtering.
		- Normalized terminology and variable/object/file names where necessary.
		- Removed two deprecated resources.
	- Itemized changes:
		- Changes to 'main.py':
			- Additions:
				- Added column renaming to 'validate_temp()' for variations on "Department" (which was somehow still
					missing despite being part of the original design documentation--big whoops).
				- Added 'Isarra (Wikimedia Commons)' to the contributors list for the use of 'Images/20/question.png'.
				- Added popup to 'exit_functions()' for exporting saved records that have not yet been written to disk.
				- Added revalidation step in 'refresh_table()' for records that change status via validation control.
				- Added the following persistent variables to 'StVars':
					- 'monitor_height': int
					- 'monitor_width': int
				- Added the following functions and their documentation:
					- 'notebook_update()'
					- 'pop_listbox()'
					- 'refresh_notebook()'
					- 'toggle_notebook()'
					- 'validate_all()'
				- Added "Validation Control" Toplevel and its components (35 objects in total).
			- Modifications and corrections:
				- Changed all instances of "category" to "department", including in object and variable names.
				- Changed naming of 'stvars' class to 'StVars' to better align with Python's capitalization conventions.
				- Corrected a sorting mistake in 'pop_filter()' where I forgot that invalid records could be deleted.
					The special sorting algorithm for invalid records is now applied to 'StVars.records_deleted' too.
				- Corrected another incorrectly written sorting command in 'pop_filter()' where I tried to sort a single
					key in a single deleted record rather than the whole deleted records list.
				- Normalized words in Datalog messages sent by 'commit_all()' to match those from 'commit_selection()'.
				- Modified default sorting algorithm to use the first column of the source file instead of "Timestamp",
					so now there are no required columns for imported files (consistency is still required, though).
				- Modified the appearance of the 'commit_popup()' to better suit the new 'Images/48/question.png'.
				- Modified toplevel positioning commands using 'root.winfo_screen*' for more accurate monitor geometry.
				- Redirected 'img_question' to use 'Images/48/question.png'.
				- Updated all instances of "v0.1.2" to "v0.1.3".
			- Removals:
				- Removed outdated to-do comment in "Section: Status bar" (the task was completed in v0.1.1, but the
					comment was not removed until now--oversight!).
			- Documentation Changes:
				- Added missing topline comments for non-list variables in 'StVars' class.
		- Notable changes to other files:
			- Added "Detailed Description" section to 'Docs/Changelog.txt', because detailing the changes to the code
				didn't sufficiently explain what changes were actually made in terms of functionality.
			- Deprecated 'Images/20/delete_selection.png' and 'Images/20/restore_selection.png'.
			- Deprecated 'Images/32/question.png' and added 'Images/48/question.png' as a replacement.
			- Renamed 'Images/20/categories.png' to 'Images/20/departments.png'.

v0.1.2 2023-04-22:
	- General description: Multiple selection enabled. Basic filtering by record status. Column sorting.
	- Changes to 'main.py':
		- Additions:
			- Added functionality to the four "Hide *" buttons and their view menu checkbutton counterparts.
				- Toggling an option from the shortcut bar will toggle it in the view menu as well, and vice versa.
				- Toggling visually depresses the shortcut buttons for clarity regarding their toggle status.
			- Added the following functions and their respective documentation:
				- 'hide_toggle()'
				- 'pop_filter()'
				- 'tree_click()'
			- Added the following persistent variables to 'stvars' class:
				- 'filter_toggle': bool = False
				- 'sort_column': str = ''
				- 'sort_descending': bool = True
		- Modifications and corrections:
			- Corrected the Datalog message sent at the end of 'validate_temp()' to be grammatically correct while only
				sending one combined message for both valid and invalid record reporting.
			- Functionality of 'delete_selection()' and 'restore_selection()' functions was redirected to
				'reject_selection()' and 'commit_selection()' respectively.
			- Modified formatting of overly long lines throughout 'main.py' for readability (except comments).
			- Modified 'refresh_table()' to account for filtering.
			- Modified 'reject_all()' to delete records temporarily rather than permanently.
			- Modified the "Review Temporary" button in 'commit_popup()' to use the new 'hide_toggle()' and
				'toggle_filter()' functions.
			- Modified the following functions and objects to handle multiple selection:
				- 'base_tree'
				- 'get_selection()'
				- 'select_toggle()'
				- 'commit_selection()'
				- 'reject_selection()'
			- Moved the section of 'validate_temp()' that rounds "Timestamp", "Cost", and "Total" columns to take place
				after the columns have been renamed to program defaults (for conciseness).
			- Moved the "Toggle Filter..." shortcut button to its correct place in the button definition list.
			- Renamed 'disable_resize()' to 'disable_resize_cursor()' and moved the actual disabling of column resizing
				into 'tree_click()'.
			- Updated all instances of "v0.1.1" to "v0.1.2".
			- Updated file header's "Description" to more accurately represent the current state of the program.
		- Removals:
			- Removed the 'delete_selection' and 'restore_selection' buttons and menu options.
			- Removed 'view_temp()' placeholder function (replaced by 'hide_toggle()').
		- Documentation Changes:
			- Added function headers and/or topline comments to the following functions:
				- 'commit_selection()'
				- 'hide_toggle()'
				- 'pop_filter()'
				- 'reject_selection()'
				- 'tree_click()'
