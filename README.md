**Description**:  
As a Disclaimerâ„¢, I find it worth mentioning that this is a college project begun after only three weeks of learning
Python. In absolutely no way will I claim it is perfect. By choosing to use this program, you accept responsibility
for the fallout of potentially clumsy coding. It is not designed to be harmful, of course, but I cannot attest to
how your system may or may not react to it; I'm not well-versed enough in Python programming to know that.

Having said that, at this time, SalesTrax functions as a simple file merger for tablular financial documents. It
reads CSV, ODS, and Excel documents, removes duplicate records, and provides a framework for manual record
exclusions in the output file, which include CSV, ODS, and XLSX format. Note that any documents without a "Date" or
"Timestamp" column WILL be rejected from being imported, but there are no other solid requirements for file content.

As of update 0.1.2, more than one record can now be selected at once, allowing CTRL and SHIFT clicking for multiple
selection. Clicking on a column header will sort the table using that column as the sort criterion, and the "Hide
Saved," "Hide Temp," "Hide Invalid," and "Hide Deleted" shortcut buttons (along with their respective "View" menu
counterparts) are now functional. Any active sorting or filtering can be reset back to program defaults by pressing
either the "Toggle Filter..." button on the shortcut bar or its counterpart in the "View" menu cascade.

PROPER filtering will not be available until a later update. Record modification, too, is planned for implementation
at some point, but I cannot promise exactly when that will be.
